# EasyBlur.dll
EasyBlur.dll for Rainmeter BETA

# HOW IT WORKS:

Basically it grabs the wallpaper from the registry, resizes it a lot, and dishes out chunks of that wallpaper for Rainmeter skins that are using the Plugin.
Since it passes the X, Y, W and H of the Widget it creates a realisitc Blur effect under it.
It's not live blur, like Windows Aero or Liquid Glass (with its millions of lines of shader code), but it's a very sleek and fast solution that doesn't increase the resource use on your computer.

But some downsides:

1. You must refresh all skins using the plugin if you changed the wallpaper (it will not auto-detect a change)
2. If you moved a skin, it will not re-apply the blur until you refresh it, or send a !ReloadBlur bang.
3. Multi-monitor support is iffy at best, as we only know what's on the Primary Screen

We are working to resolve these two and maybe someone in the Rainmeter community can help us with that :)

# HOW TO USE IT IN YOUR SKINS:

First, include EasyBlur.dll with the x32 / x64 Plugins folders.
Then include these lines in your Skin(s):
```
[EasyBlur]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=EasyBlur
ScreenAreaWidth=#ScreenAreaWidth#
ScreenAreaHeight=#ScreenAreaHeight#
XPos=#CURRENTCONFIGX#
YPos=#CURRENTCONFIGY#
XWidth=520
XHeight=328

[Blur]
Meter=Image
ImageName=[EasyBlur]
DynamicVariables=1
solidcolor=0,0,0,255
w=500
h=300
x=10
y=10
```
The [Blur] will be the actual image, so you can do stuff to it also, such as applying effects, re-sizing it, or adding more meters to layer it. See the example of this Skin, by right-clicking and selecting Edit.

#ADDITIONAL OPTIONS

The demo has these 3 options that you can play around with.

This lets you change how intense the blur should be:
Intensity=3

Creates a magnifying-glass like effect, depending on value:
Zoom=1.5

Will use a provided image instead of the windows wallpaper as the blur:
ImagePath=C:\Users\User\Pictures\Wall.jpg



EXTRA REFRESH

If you include this line under [Rainmeter] in your skin, it will, at least, refresh the blur when you moved the widget (and moved your mouse away from it)
```
[Rainmeter]
Update=-1
MouseLeaveAction=!execute [!CommandMeasure "EasyBlur" "!ReloadBlur"]
```
